Hi Sam,
I am sending an update to File 561 this time. It is an XMIT PDS file.
I sent the whole library (as I now have it) as there were a lot of
cosmetic changes to members. The principal change of value is the
addition of the $$README member.

I deleted the following members as of no value: ASME, CBC3GIS9, CT,
FELEREXX, EWXREF, OWNER, PST, SMPE0, TESTMAC, XREFPUT, XTUPDATE

Thanks again for your work,
Dick

Note from Sam Golob:   I kept what Dick says he deleted.  Maybe
                       somebody can use some code from these
                       members.  The idea that Dick deleted the
                       stuff, is that he doesn't vouch for its
                       usefulness or its accuracy.  That's why we
                       are mentioning these member names--to just
                       let you know about the "status" of these
                       particular pds members.
